### Eco-innovative environmental solutions

The Laboratory of Chemical and Environmental Engineering (LEQUIA) is a research group of the University of Girona (UdG) devoted to the development of eco-innovative environmental solutions. LEQUIA is a part of the UdG‚Äôs Institute of the Environment (IMA) and participates actively in Campus UdG Water. LEQUIA is a ‚Äúconsolidated research group‚Äù recognised by the Catalan Government (2021-SGR-1352) and a member of TECNIO, a network that brings together leading experts in applied research and technology transfer in Catalonia.

 
## The team
LEQUIA has a team of 40 people, including university professors, post-doctoral and pre-doctoral researchers, and technical and management support staff. Because our work is multidisciplinary, LEQUIA projects currently involve environmental scientists, chemists, biologists, engineers and computer scientists.

## Facilities
The group is based in the Faculty of Sciences of the UdG (Montilivi Campus) and a 550m2 area in the Jaume Casademont building of the UdG‚Äôs Science and Technology Park. We have an analytical chemistry laboratory; fully instrumented pilot plants with different configurations for wastewater treatment at laboratory/semi-industrial scale; photoreactors for advanced oxidation processes; and software for environmental modelling and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies.

 
## Projects
Research activity is carried out with funds from national and international R&D projects, and technology transfer contracts with public and private organisations. Between 2019 and 2022, LEQUIA had an average turnover of 1.57 million euros (of which, 18% came from private funds).

 
## Post-graduate education
LEQUIA has always played an active role in postgraduate and doctorate programs of the University of Girona, such as the Master in Water Resources and the Doctorate Programme in Water Science and Technology. Currently, the group coordinates Erasmus+ project INOWASIA focused on the development of innovative multilevel formation programs for the new water leading professionals in South East Asia.

## Quality Certification

LEQUIA has a quality assurance management system certified by the Catalan Agency for Enterprise Competitiveness (ACCI√ì) and based on ISO 9000 standards and the EFQM excellence model.
